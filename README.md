# OrigiNet
Non-linearities improve originet based on active imaging for micro expression recognition

**Active Imaging:** 
run "ActiveImaging.py" Note: /vid #video folder for dynamic image generation!

**OrigiNet Architecture:**

To create a structure of the model, run the "demo.py" file. !!! 


THE CODE IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUN IN THE UBUNTU SYSTEM, TO RUN IT IN WINDOWS, PLEASE CHANGE THE FILE PATH IN THE CODES ACCORDINGLY !!!
